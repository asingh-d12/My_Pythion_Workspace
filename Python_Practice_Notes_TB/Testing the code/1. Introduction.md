Once you are done with coding, it is always a good idea to thoughrouly test this code.

It is not that you test your code with few known values and you are done, always test code with as many values as possible.

Basically we should test a couple of things:
>1. Edge Cases - Edge Case basically refers to the very extreme values(at lower end or at higher end) which our code can support.

>2. Corner Cases - occurs outside of normal operating parameters, specifically when multiple environmental variables or conditions are simultaneously at extreme levels, even though each parameter is within the specified range for that parameter

***

Let's take a look at this code that we created to remove outliers that is values are not within a specified range. Here the range is 100-200.
```
# Let's check out how to delete from list
# a_list = [4, 5, 104, 105, 110, 120, 130, 130, 150, 160,
#           170, 183, 185, 187, 188, 191, 350, 360]
# print(a_list)
# print("*" * 100)

# Delete numbers that are not between a min and max value
# min_val = 100
# max_val = 200
# 
# for index, val in enumerate(a_list):
#     if not min_val < val < max_val:
#         del a_list[index]
# 
# print(a_list)

# This is not correct as seen in the output
# basically whenever you delete on a same mutable data structure that you are iterating over
# you are bound to face issues like these

print("*" * 100)

# How to correctly do this::
a_list = [4, 5, 104, 105, 110, 120, 130, 130, 150, 160,
          170, 183, 185, 187, 188, 191, 350, 360]
min_val = 100
max_val = 200
i = 0
print(a_list)
while i < len(a_list):
    if not min_val < a_list[i] < max_val:
        del a_list[i]
        i -= 1
    i += 1

print(a_list)


```

PFB all the cases we should test our code for:
1. Outlying Values on both low and high end - Already tested when created the code.
2. Outlying values at low end only.
3. Outlying values at high end only.
4. No Outlying values.
5. Only Outlying values(no valid ones).
6. An empty data set.

Let's test other 5 cases:
Case 2: Outlying values at low end only.

changing the following:
```
a_list = [4, 5, 104, 105, 110, 120, 130, 130, 150, 160,
          170, 183, 185, 187, 188, 191]
```

Output : 
![[Pasted image 118.png]]

**This Works**

Case 3: Outlying values at high end only.

changing the following:
```
a_list = [104, 105, 110, 120, 130, 130, 150, 160,
          170, 183, 185, 187, 188, 191, 350, 360]
```

Output : 
![[Pasted image 119.png]]

**This Works**

Case 4: No Outlying Values.

changing the following:
```
a_list = [104, 105, 110, 120, 130, 130, 150, 160,
          170, 183, 185, 187, 188, 191]
```

Output : 
![[Pasted image 120.png]]

**This Works**

Case 5:  Only Outlying Values.

changing the following:
```
a_list = list(range(1, 99, 3)) + list(range(1021, 2000, 100))
```

Output : 
![[Pasted image 121.png]]

**This Works**

Case 6:  An empty dataset.

changing the following:
```
a_list = []
```

Output : 
![[Pasted image 123.png]]

**This Works**

## Another algorithms for deleting ouliers.. by Traversing from right to left.... and this works...
```
# So earlier we noticed if we try removing items from the list while iterating over it,
# it can cause issues.

# and for we used some ways to overcome that

# Though will the issues still remain if we iterate backwards
a_list = [4, 5, 104, 105, 110, 120, 130, 130, 150, 160,
          170, 183, 185, 187, 188, 191, 350, 360]

min_val = 100
max_val = 200

# print(range(1, 100)[0:10:2])

# Remember enumerate is not a sequence type... thus not subsriptable directly
for i, an_item in list(enumerate(a_list))[::-1]:
    if not min_val < an_item < max_val:
        del a_list[i]

print(a_list)

# So, a sorted list works great with traversing back method...
# Why does traversing back method work?
# Simple,
# Because whether item is set to delete or now... the pointer will always shift left
# and if item is deleted... whatever is shifting to left is already been traversed.. so no negative effects

print("*" * 100)

# Let's try the same method with unsorted list... it should work
a_list = [104, 101, 4, 105, 308, 103, 5, 107, 100, 306, 106, 102, 108]
for i, an_item in list(enumerate(a_list))[::-1]:
    if not min_val < an_item < max_val:
        del a_list[i]

print(a_list)

print("*" * 100)
# Let's check out another way to delete from list
# this one using method reversed
# We are not explicitly converting enumerate object to list here
# But that has a disadvantage
a_list = [104, 101, 4, 105, 308, 103, 5, 107, 100, 306, 106, 102, 108]
org_len = len(a_list)
for index, item in enumerate(reversed(a_list)):
    # Yep, that's the disadvantage... it will give 0 index to last item
    # print(index, item)
    # But we can go pass that with manipulating the index itself
    index = org_len - index - 1
    # Next, Logic to delete
    if not min_val < item < max_val:
        print(index, item)
        del a_list[index]

print(a_list)
