Binary Search is basically one of the most important and simple algorithms used in several places most importantly databases.

**So, what is Binary Search?**

There is 1 pre-requisite for Binary Search:
> If you are searching in a list/array, it should be sorted for Binary Search to work.

So, what exactly happens in Binary Search.

We have a sorted list a
a = [1, 2, 3, 4.....n]
and we want to search x in the list mentioned above.

So, what are we doing in Binary Search:
1. We take start position and end position, the first time it being
	start = 0
	end = n-1
2. Now we will reach at mid point using start and end, so
	mid = (start + end) // 2
3. Next, compare the number to search x with a\[mid\]
4. if x == a\[mid\]
	great, you are done
5. if x > a\[mid\]
	1. that means that number to search x is on the right of current mid position(since the list is sorted)
	2. In this case we are going to move to right half of the list now since we know number can not be to the left of mid position
	3. so, we are going to change start poistion now, so that we move to right of the mid position
		start = mid + 1
	4. Next, repeat step 2 - 6
6. if x < a\[mid\]
	1. that means number to search x is to the left of current mid position.
	2. In this case we are going to move to left half of the list now since we know number can not be to the right of mid position
	3. so, we are going to change end poistion now, so that we move to left of the mid position
		end = mid - 1
	4. Next, repeat step 2 - 6


By following the above steps, what we are doing is essentially halving the list in which we are searching every time.
So,
let's say len(a) = n
so with each iteration the search is done in:
n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + n/16 + .... + n/2^k

What this pattern is actually:

so we know this
n/2^k = 1
n = 2^k
lg n = k

SO COMPLEXITY OF BINARY SEARCH
O(lg n)

PFB a couple of examples of Binary Search:

1. To guess a correct number:
```
max_val = 1000
print("Please think of a number 1 - 1000, and I will try to guess in 10 tries...")
input("Press Enter to Start!!")

# user_input = int(input("Please guess a number between 1 and {} : ".format(max_val)))

# So, here we are using Binary Search, so instead of taking input from user, let's take how this works
start = 1
end = 1000

mid_pt_guess = (start + end) // 2

attempt_num = 1

# Let's transform this code so that we can run this with while loop
while True:
    print("My guess is {}. Is this your number??".format(mid_pt_guess))
    h_or_l = input("Please enter h/high/higher if your number is higher than my guess.\n"
                   "Please enter l/low/lower if your number is lower than my guess.\n"
                   "Just Press Enter if this is your number.\nPlease Enter : ")
    if 'l' in h_or_l.casefold():
        end = mid_pt_guess - 1
    elif 'h' in h_or_l.casefold():
        start = mid_pt_guess + 1
    else:
        print("*" * 100)
        print("Awesome, your number is {}, and it took me {} attempts to guess it.".format(mid_pt_guess, attempt_num))
        break
    mid_pt_guess = (start + end) // 2
    attempt_num += 1

```

***Number I thought of was 837***

2. To Search in a list(make sure it is sorted)
```
import random

# First let's create some random List
a_list = list(range(1, 1001))


# This is a random list generator, which is actually something not used in Binary Search.. because List is to be sorted
# first
def random_list_gen():
    num_of_runs = 0

    while True:
        to_add = random.randint(1, 100)
        num_of_runs += 1
        print("Number to add = {}".format(to_add))
        if to_add in a_list:
            print("Number {} already present, skipping this number".format(to_add))
            continue
        a_list.append(to_add)
        print("{} added".format(to_add))
        if len(a_list) == 100:
            break

    print(a_list)
    print("Complete list created in {} runs of while loop".format(num_of_runs))


print("*" * 100)


# Next Part is binary search algorithm
def b_s(start, end, to_search):
    global rec_level
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    rec_level += 1
    if to_search == a_list[mid]:
        print("You have searched the number {} at position".format(mid))
        return
    elif to_search > a_list[mid]:
        start = mid + 1
        b_s(start, end, to_search)
    else:
        end = mid - 1
        b_s(start, end, to_search)


def main():
    global rec_level
    to_search_l = random.randint(1, 1001)
    print("I am going to search number = {}".format(to_search_l))
    start_l = 0
    end_l = len(a_list) - 1
    b_s(start_l, end_l, to_search_l)
    print("Searched in {} times".format(rec_level))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    for i in range(50):
        rec_level = 0
        main()

```

## Note, All Searches are done in 10 or lower times when working with 1000 numbers
