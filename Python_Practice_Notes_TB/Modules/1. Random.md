Random is one of the most useful module used in Python, and is mainly used to create Random numbers.

Let's take a look at an example when we were running A guessing game, and number to be guessed was same all the time.

Now we want to change this number.

Other than that we also will be using while loop to provide more than 1 or 2 chances to user to guess the correct number.

Let's see how this works. PFB the code:
```
import random

max_val = 100
to_guess = random.randint(1, max_val)

user_input = int(input("Please guess a number between 1 and 100 : "))

attempt_num = 1

# Let's transform this code so that we can run this with while loop
while user_input != to_guess:
    if user_input > to_guess:
        print("Incorrect!! Please guess lower.")
    elif user_input < to_guess:
        print("Incorrect!! Please guess higher.")
    user_input = int(input("Please guess a number between 1 and 100 : "))
    attempt_num += 1

print("You guessed correctly on Attempt Number = {}".format(attempt_num))

```

**This is the snippet that produces a random int and binds it to to_guess**
```
import random

max_val = 100
to_guess = random.randint(1, max_val)
```
