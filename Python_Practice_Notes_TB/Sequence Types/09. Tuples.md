## Tuples are ordered set of data
1 major difference between tuples and strings is that tuples are immutable.
What that means is that they can't change, just like strings.

Check out this code:
```
# Let's start with how to create tuples
# 1. Tuple Literal - Part 1
t = "a", "b", "c"
# This is a tuple
print(t)

# 2. Tuple Literal - with parantheses
t1 = ("a", "b", "c")
print(t1)

# The output from both are basically the same
# But sometimes it is important to use parantheses
# Check out this example
x = 1
y = 2
# This prints x, y and then a tuple that contains (1, 2
print(x, y, (1, 2))  # 1
# What if we print x, y, 1, 2
print(x, y, 1, 2)  # 2

# As you can see
# 1 - prints a tuple
# 2 - does not print tuple, even if we think 1, 2 should be a tuple

## Where are tuples actually useful?

Tuples are subscriptable.
Baically we can use index\[100\] sort of value with tuple

**Tuples are IMMUTABLE**

Check out this code:
```
welcome = "Welcome to my Nightmare", "Alice Cooper", 1975
bad = "Bad Company", "Bad Company", 1974
budgie = "Nightflight", "Budgie", 1981
imelda = "More Mayhem", "Emilda May", 2011
metallica = "Ride the Lightning", "Metallica", 1984

# We have 5 tuples above, let's print 1
print(metallica)
# Tuples are subscriptable
print(metallica[0])
print(metallica[1])
print(metallica[2])

# Tuples are IMMUTABLE
# Let's check out
metallica[0] = "Singles Day"
# If we try the statement above we get the following error
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

> One major Performance Advantage of tuple is Saving Memory
	> 1. If your program are using millions of list, but you do not require your lists to change, you can employee tuples
	> 2. This saves memory because tuples does not have overhead of methods that are used to change lists
	> 3. So, if you have millions of lists, then you can save memory by using tuples instead of lists.

### SO 1 major reason of using tuple, if you don't want your data to be altered. Like we noticed in the code above.

## Unpacking a Tuple
This is something similar to what we can do with Lists as well
Let's check out what unpacking means:

```
# We can do something like this, when we are writing code:
x = y = z = 132
# Basically binding same value to 3 variables
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

print('*' * 50)

# We can also do this
x, y, z = 1500, 345, 22
# This is unpacking a tuple
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

print('*' * 50)

# Let's create a tuple
a_tuple = "Amrit", 30, "M"
name, age, gender = a_tuple
# This is also UNPACKING TUPLE
print(name)
print(age)
print(gender)


```

**Note: Unpacking works with list as well**

*Though not recommended if list is changing*
```
# Unpacking a List is also possible
names = ["Amrit", "Lucky", "Ravi"]
n1, n2, n3 = names
print(n1)
print(n2)
print(n3)
names[1] = "Jupnit"
print(names)
# I think n2 will still be Lucky
print(n2)

print("*" * 100)

# One issue with unpacking lists
a_list = ["Amrit", "Lucky", "Ravi"]
# Some days later i am adding this code
a_list.remove("Lucky")
# Will the line below work now?
n1, n2, n3 = a_list
print(n1)
print(n2)
print(n3)

```
