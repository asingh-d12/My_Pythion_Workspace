### sorted() built-in function
Out of iterables, we can only sort sequence types, and that too only mutable once...that means only **list**

We definitely can not sort set or a dictionary since they are **un-ordered** by design.

We can not sort tuple because of its **immutability**

Despite the 2 statements above, Here right now, i am using the **a built-in function sorted()**, this can be used on any iterable, though pfb how it sorts:

Though there are some small concessions:
1. Even though we can't sort set or dictionary, we can get a sorted list of the items in the set or dictionary.
	PFB an example:
	```
	a_set = {3, 1, 5, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 4, 3}
	print(sorted(a_set))
	```
	
	>**Output**

	If you try sorting a set or a dictionary, you will get a list in return.
	
2. What if I try sorting a tuple.
	PFB an example:
	```
	a_tuple = (1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 87, 12, 34, 56, 12, 1)
	print(sorted(a_tuple))
	```
	>**Output**

3. Lastly, most simple.. if i try sorting a llist using sorted() function.
	PFB an example:
	```
	a_list = [3, 4, 1, 5, 12, 51, 12, 34, 53, 123, 12]
	print(sorted(a_list))
	```
	
	> **Output**

***
As noticed from the code above, we can use simple built-in sorted() function to sort any iterable... **catch being it will always return a list of sorted items, with original iterable remaining the same**

### .sort() method
Only present in the list, as it can only be sorted in the way that .sort() method sorts
> Mainly sort the list and update the original list

PFB an example:
```
a_list = [3, 4, 1, 5, 12, 51, 12, 34, 53, 123, 12]
print("Listed from sorted() function = {}".format(sorted(a_list)))
print("Original list after sorted() = {}".format(a_list))
print("What is returned when .sort() method is used = {}".format(a_list.sort()))
print("Original list after .sort() method = {}".format(a_list))
```

***
**Conclusion:**
1. .sort() method works on the list itself, and discards the original list and updates it wil the sorted list. Also, it returns None.
2. .sort() method is much more advantageous, in case you have a list that is Megabytes or Gigabytes in size, and you don't want to run out of memory.

### Case-Insensitive Sorting

There is a concept of Keyword Arguments that we learn when learning more about functions, but what these are basically some arguments that we can provide in functions that have some default values if we don't send any argument when calling these function/method.

There is 1 keyword argument called **key** which is there for both sorted() function and .sort() method.

PFB the signature:
> sorted(iterable, *, key=None, reverse=False)

> sort(*, key=None, reverse=False)

reverse=False is straigtforward, if we call the function with reverse=True... it will sort in reverse order.

**What is key though??**
> key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, key=str.lower). The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. The default value of None means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value.

What it basically means is that each element that is used for sorting will first go through the function being provided in the key, and what the result is will actually go through the sorting.

so in case we want case-insensitive sorting... we can use str.lower or str.casefold

PFB the code:
```
pangram = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
print(pangram)
print(sorted(pangram))
print(sorted(pangram, key=str.casefold))
```
