## So, what does it means to be Mutable or Immutable?
**IMMUTABLE OBJECTS** 
Basically means that an item can not be changed no matter what.

Following are the Immutable types built into Python:
1. int
2. bool
3. string
4. float
5. str
6. tupe
7. frozenset
8. bytes

for int
a value remains same no matter what
1 is always 1, and can not be changed no matter what
if we say 1 + 1 = 2.. then it becomes 2 and not 1.

Same for float
10.212 remains 10.212 no matter what

bools are immutable, as they are basically subclass of int

***
PFB the code snippet with details regarding immutable string and boolean using id() function to check the address:
```
# So here we are going to use a new function
# id()
# returns the identification or in terms of computer the address of an object
# CPython compiler returns address of the object, but not all compilers may be the same
# So, if you start with 1 object, it will remain same until the object is destroyed
# String
a_str = "Hello Amrit"
a_str_2 = "Hello Amrit"
a_str_3 = a_str
print(id(a_str) == id(a_str_2))

print(id(a_str))
print(id(a_str_3))

# Let's bind a_str to different value
a_str += "Sing with me"
print(id(a_str))
print(id(a_str_3))

# CONCLUSION : STRING VALUE BINDS TO A VALUE, and THAT VALUE CAN"T BE CHANGED
# WHEN TRYING TO ASSIGN A DIFFERENT VALUE, IT SIMPLY BINDS TO DIFFERENT VALUE

print("*" * 100)

# Boolean
a_result = True
second_result = True
third_result = a_result

print(id(a_result))
print(id(second_result))
print(id(third_result))

# Changing 1 variable to false
a_result = not a_result
print(a_result)
print(id(a_result))

# Changing it back to True
a_result = not a_result
print(id(a_result))

# So, no matter how many time a boolean variable changes from true to false or
# Vice Versa... the address of True and False remains the same.

# CONCLUSION: SO, WHAT WE CAN SAY IS FOR BOOLEAN... WE DON'T REALLY ASSIGN VALUES TO BOOLEAN VARIABLE
# WE BIND BOOLEAN VARIABLES TO JUST 2 MEMORY LOCATIONS THAT CONTAIN TRUE AND FALSE

print("*" * 100)

```

**MUTABLE OBJECTS**
Objects that can be changed.

PFB the built-in mutable objects:
1. List
2. Dict
3. Set
4. Bytearray

***
Let's do the following:
1. Create a list 
2. use id() function on it
3. change that list
4. use id() function again

```
greetings = ["Hello", "Hi", "Hola", "Namaste", "Sat Sri Akal", "Good Day"]
print(greetings)
print(id(greetings))

# No let's alter 1 greeting
greetings[5] = "Good Day Sir"
print(greetings)
print(id(greetings))

# CONCLUSION: SO, EVEN AFTER CHANGING AN ELEMENT OF THE LIST... THE ADDRESS REMAINED THE SAME
print("*" * 100)
print("Check this out")
print("1. Create a List, or take from previous code...")
computer_parts = ["computer",
                  "mouse",
                  "keyboard",
                  "mouse",
                  "mouse mat"
                  ]
print(computer_parts)
print("Address of computer_parts = {}".format(id(computer_parts)))
print("2. Now bind another variable to this list...")
my_computer_parts = computer_parts
print("Printing second variable.. my_computer_parts")
print(my_computer_parts)
print("Address of my_computer_parts = {}".format(id(my_computer_parts)))
print("3. Now changing list binded to computer_parts variable, adding a printer in it...")
computer_parts.append("Printer")
print("4. Print computer_parts and my_computer_parts list again..")
print("computer_parts = {}".format(computer_parts))
print("my_computer_parts = {}".format(my_computer_parts))
print("Address of computer_parts = {}".format(id(computer_parts)))
print("Address of my_computer_parts = {}".format(id(my_computer_parts)))

```

**PFB the link to operations that can be performed on Mutable Sequence Types.**

https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types

Let's check out a couple of operations:
```
# Starting with what we can do with lists
a_list = ["Amrit",
          "Lucky",
          "Ravi",
          "Singh"
          ]

# 1. replacing a single item
print(a_list)
a_list[1] = "Jupnit"
print(a_list)

print("*" * 50)

# 2. Replacing multiple items through slices
# Remember, here an iterable is required
# Basically anything you bind the values to needs to be iterable, whether it be string or a list
a_list[1:3] = ["Lucky", "Ravinder"]
print(a_list)
print("*" * 50)
# An odd example
a_list[2:3] = "Lucky"
print(a_list)

```
