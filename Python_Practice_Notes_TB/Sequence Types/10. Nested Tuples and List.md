What about storing all the albums(an album being a tuple (name, artist, year)) in a single list.

Check out the following code:
```
welcome = "Welcome to my Nightmare", "Alice Cooper", 1975
bad = "Bad Company", "Bad Company", 1974
budgie = "Nightflight", "Budgie", 1981
imelda = "More Mayhem", "Emilda May", 2011
metallica = "Ride the Lightning", "Metallica", 1984

# So, we have these 5 tuples, each representing an album
# What if we want these albums to be in a single list
albums = [("Welcome to my Nightmare", "Alice Cooper", 1975),
          ("Bad Company", "Bad Company", 1974),
          ("Nightflight", "Budgie", 1981),
          ("More Mayhem", "Emilda May", 2011),
          ("Ride the Lightning", "Metallica", 1984)
          ]

# Now albums is a list containing all the albums, each album being a tuple
# Now we can traverse through all these albums
for an_album in albums:
    album_name, artist, yr = an_album
    print("{} - {} - {}".format(album_name, artist, yr))

```

Let's do this nesting further.

Say, we want to add songs in each album as well.

Here we are creating list ot tuples of list of tuples
```
albums = [
    ("Welcome to my Nightmare", "Alice Cooper", 1975,
     [
         (1, "Welcome to my Nightmare"),
         (2, "Devil's Food"),
         (3, "The Black Widow"),
         (4, "Some Folks"),
         (5, "Only Women Bleed"),
     ]
     ),
    ("Bad Company", "Bad Company", 1974,
     [
         (1, "Can't Get Enough"),
         (2, "Rock Steady"),
         (3, "Ready for Love"),
         (4, "Don't Let Me Down"),
         (5, "Bad Company"),
         (6, "The Way I Choose"),
         (7, "Movin' On"),
         (8, "Seagull"),
     ]
     ),
    ("Nightflight", "Budgie", 1981,
     [
         (1, "I Turned to Stone"),
         (2, "Keeping a Rendezvous"),
         (3, "Reaper of the Glory"),
         (4, "She Used Me Up"),
     ]
     ),
    ("More Mayhem", "Imelda May", 2011,
     [
         (1, "Pulling the Rug"),
         (2, "Psycho"),
         (3, "Mayhem"),
         (4, "Kentish Town Waltz"),
     ]
     ),
]
```
