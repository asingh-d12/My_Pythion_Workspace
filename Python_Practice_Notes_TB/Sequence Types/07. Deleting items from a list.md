## "del" through slices

check out the following code:
```
# Let's check out how to delete from list
a_list = [4, 5, 104, 105, 110, 120, 130, 130, 150, 160,
          170, 183, 185, 187, 188, 191, 350, 360]
print(a_list)
print("*" * 100)

# Delete first 2 values from the list
print("Delete first 2 values from the list")
del a_list[0:2]
print(a_list)

print("*" * 100)
# Delete last 2 items as well
print("Delete last 2 items as well")
del a_list[-2:]
print(a_list)

```

## "del" through logic

Delete numbers that are not between 100 and 200

**Wrong approach**
```
# Let's check out how to delete from list
a_list = [4, 5, 104, 105, 110, 120, 130, 130, 150, 160,
          170, 183, 185, 187, 188, 191, 350, 360]
print(a_list)
print("*" * 100)

# Delete numbers that are not between a min and max value
min_val = 100
max_val = 200

for index, val in enumerate(a_list):
    if not min_val < val < max_val:
        del a_list[index]

print(a_list)

# This is not correct as seen in the output
# basically whenever you delete on a same mutable data structure that you are iterating over
# you are bound to face issues like these

```
