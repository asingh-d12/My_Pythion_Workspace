A Sequence is an ordered collection of items.

What it means to be ordered...
Basically means we can get the location of each individual item in a sequece, as they can be accessed through indexes.

For ex:

The very basic Sequence Type  - String...
So, you have a String
```
a_str = "My name is amrit"
# Now we can refer each and every element or character in this string(sequece type) through index. This is only possible because Strings are ordered collection of items.
```
Basically in the above example:
a_str[4] will return 'a' and so on.

**Also, if we iterate through a Sequence Types, we will always get the items in same order no matter what.**

All Sequence Types are iterable... what does that mean??
Basically we can iterate over them and go over each item in a Sequence...

*what it actually means or how a sequence can be an iterable??*
**Basically the Sequence will have either __iter__() method or __getitem__() method defined in them.**

Example: All Sequences like Strings, Tuples, Lists are iterables.

**But Not all Iterables are Sequences**
ex of this :  Dictionary is an iterable as we can go through its elements using for loop, but is not actually a sequence.

***
In this section, the iterables we are going to refer are sequence types.
