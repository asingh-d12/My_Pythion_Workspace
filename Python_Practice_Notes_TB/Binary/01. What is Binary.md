Computers work in binary - basically 2 states -- on and off or 1 and 0

Now how binary works is important to understand if i want to work with Binary Data.

Binary is number system just like decimal, the main difference being decimal is based on 0-9, whereas binary is based on 0 and 1.

let's check a couple of decimal numbers represented as computer sees them:

Let's check out binary now:

Let's check out some code that is converting decimal number to binary:
```
for i in range(17):
    # b is the character converting a decimal number to binary
    print("{0:>2} in binary is {0:>08b}".format(i))

print("*" * 10)

# To create binary values
a_binary_Val = 0b1010
print(a_binary_Val)


```

Fun Fact : With 32 bits we can only represent 4GB of memory space.. i.e. 2^32

## Addition in Binary
![[Pasted image 141.png]]

basically:
0+1 = 1
0+0 = 0
1+0 = 1
1 + 1 = 0 and carry 1



## Substraction in Binary

Works similar to addition
![[Pasted image 143.png]]

1-0 = 1
1-1 = 0
0-0 = 0
0-1 = 1 borrow 1 from next bit

 ## Binary Shift Left
 What is shift left
 Basically a binary operator where if you shift left once, you insert 0 at the end of the number.
 Check out the screenshot:

 Basically Multiply by 2.. 
 Think of this as this way, when you shift left in decimal... it can be considered as multiply by 10
 
 ## Binary Shift Right
 You can shift right as well... and it can be considered as division by 2
 
 ## Binary OR
 basically 
 0 or 0 = 0
 o or 1 = 1
 1 or 0 = 1
 1 or 1 = 1

  ## Binary AND
  basically
  1 and 0 = 0
  0 and 1 = 0
  0 and 0 = 0
  1 and 1 = 1

  ## X-OR
  basically
  1 xor 0 = 1
  0 xor 1 = 1
  0 xor 0 = 0
  1 xor 1 = 0

  **xor is useful in the way that if you repeat the operation, you get the number back**

  **xor is used in encryption**
