When doing programming, we usually don't use Binary.. mainly it is tedious to mantain and speak about, and thus can be error prone
Instead we use Hex in those cases, as there is one major advantage of Hex:
> 1. Hexadecimal is base 16, which is an exact power of 2. It helps in remaining close to underline binary, and that is really helpful when working with memory addresses or operation on individual bits.
> 2. Hex are shorter to write... numbers from 0 to 255 can be written in 2 Hex Digits. Numbers from 0 to 65535 can be written in 4 hex digits.

In Hexadecimal:
0 to 15 are represented as following:
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
A - to represent decimal 10
B - 11
C - 12
D - 13
E - 14
F - 15

Each Hex Digit represents 4 Binary Digits??
hex is 2^4
that means 4 binary digits or bits
4 binary digits in collection is called a nibble

so each hex digit is represented by a nibble.

soooo.. to represent a 8 bit byte, 2 Hex Digits are used.

Check out this code that converts decimal number to binary and hex:
```
for i in range(18):
    print("{0:>2} in binary is {0:>08b} in hex is {0:>2x}".format(i))

```

There is 1 major problem here:
10 
is it a decimal number representing value 10?
or a hex representing 16?

So, how do we actually say that this is a hex number 10 and not decimal number 10

### Python along with several other programming languages allows a prefix '0x' to represent hex numbers.

Let's check some code now:
```
for i in range(18):
    print("{0:>2} in binary is {0:>08b} in hex is {0:>2x}".format(i))

```

```
# This represents hex numbers
x_hex = 0x20  # this represents 32
y_hex = 0x0a  # this represents 10
print(x_hex * y_hex)  # we are getting 320 from here

```

***
We can also perform hex calculations - subtraction, add, multiply and divide.. but it is better to convert them to decimal and do the calculation and convert the result back... or do with a computer of a calculator.
