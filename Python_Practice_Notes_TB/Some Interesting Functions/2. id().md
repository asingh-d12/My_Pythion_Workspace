## Returns the address of an object, at least CPython compiler does

So, if you create an object, until and unless it is destroyed it will have the same id no matter what.

So, if we want to confirm if object is changed or different, we can use id to check it's address.

PFB the code snippet with details regarding immutable string and boolean using id() function to check the address:
```
# So here we are going to use a new function
# id()
# returns the identification or in terms of computer the address of an object
# CPython compiler returns address of the object, but not all compilers may be the same
# So, if you start with 1 object, it will remain same until the object is destroyed
# String
a_str = "Hello Amrit"
a_str_2 = "Hello Amrit"
a_str_3 = a_str
print(id(a_str) == id(a_str_2))

print(id(a_str))
print(id(a_str_3))

# Let's bind a_str to different value
a_str += "Sing with me"
print(id(a_str))
print(id(a_str_3))

# CONCLUSION : STRING VALUE BINDS TO A VALUE, and THAT VALUE CAN"T BE CHANGED
# WHEN TRYING TO ASSIGN A DIFFERENT VALUE, IT SIMPLY BINDS TO DIFFERENT VALUE

print("*" * 100)

# Boolean
a_result = True
second_result = True
third_result = a_result

print(id(a_result))
print(id(second_result))
print(id(third_result))

# Changing 1 variable to false
a_result = not a_result
print(a_result)
print(id(a_result))

# Changing it back to True
a_result = not a_result
print(id(a_result))

# So, no matter how many time a boolean variable changes from true to false or
# Vice Versa... the address of True and False remains the same.

# CONCLUSION: SO, WHAT WE CAN SAY IS FOR BOOLEAN... WE DON'T REALLY ASSIGN VALUES TO BOOLEAN VARIABLE
# WE BIND BOOLEAN VARIABLES TO JUST 2 MEMORY LOCATIONS THAT CONTAIN TRUE AND FALSE

print("*" * 100)

```
