## Checking conditions with **in, or and and**

How to do this:

Say for ex, if we want to check a certain age bracket.
```
my_age = int(input("What is your age : "))

if my_age >= 17 and my_age <= 65:
    print("Have a good day at work.")

```

so, basically this is how and works.

The expression
```
my_age >= 17 and my_age <= 65
```
will only be true if both the expressions
```
my_age >= 17
```
and
```
my_age <= 65
```
are True.

**PFB the or condition combination table**

***
When writing and condition, we can simplify the code by doing the following:
```
if 17 <= my_age <= 65:
```

instead of

```
if my_age >= 17 and my_age <= 65:
```

## What if i want to do above check using or instead of and

Check this code out:
```
my_age = int(input("What is your age : "))

print("Using AND")
# if my_age >= 17 and my_age <= 65:
if 17 <= my_age <= 65:
    print("Have a good day at work.")
else:
    print("No work for you.")

print("*" * 50)

print("Using OR")
if my_age <= 16 or my_age >65:
    print("No Work for you.")
else:
    print("Have a good day at work.")

```

## What is Short Circuiting the and/or operator?

**When Comparing conditions with 'AND', python will stop comparison if the first condition is FALSE. It won't go to any of the consequent conditions as python knows no matter what the whole expression will always be FALSE.**

**When Comparing conditions with 'OR', python will stop comparison if the first condition is TRUE. It won't go to any of the consequent conditions as python knows no matter what the whole expression will always be TRUE.**

Here is an example of the usefulness of this, Check this code out:
```
username = input("Please enter your username : ")

if username and input("Please enter your Password : ") == "Hello World":
    print("You are logged in!!")

```

If username is entered.

If username is not entered.
