## Iterating over a range
Ranges are also iterable, though not sequence type.. we can still iterate over it.

Let's check this code out:
```
for i in range(1, 20):
    print(i)

```

Range also like slices doesn't include the last value... basically from start to end - 1

**Range without start value**
*then It defaults to 0*

PFB the code:
```
# If we don't provide start value in range, then it defaults to 0
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

**Range with a Step**

*Warning: If you provide Step.. Start Value is needed as well... otherwise step is taken as end*

PFB the code:
```
# If we want to provide 'step', 'start' value is required as well
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)

print('*' * 100)

# if we don't provide 'start' when trying to use 'step'
# then what we consider 'end' will be considered as 'start' by Python..
# and what we consider 'step' will be considered as 'end' by python
for i in range(10, 2):
    print(i)

# Nothing will be printed for this, as end < start

print('*' * 100)
```

***

**Negative Step**

We can also provide a negative step...*though make sure that start value is higher than stop value.*

PFB the code:
```
# Now we are going to use Negative step
# Though make sure that start > stop...
# In that case only negative step makes sense
for i in range(10, 1, -2):
    print(i)

```

**We can also use range in conditions**

PFB the code:
```
my_age = int(input("What is your age : "))

# if my_age >= 17 and my_age <= 65:
# if 17 <= my_age <= 65:
# Even though the above mentioned method is most efficient
# For the purpose of learning, let's try the above mentioned condition with a range.
if my_age in range(17, 66):
    print("Have a good day at work.")
else:
    print("No work for you.")

```
