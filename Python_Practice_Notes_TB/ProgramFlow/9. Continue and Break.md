Sometimes it is required to interrupt the normal flow of the loop, either jump out of completely or stop the current iteration and move to next iteration.

## Continue

**What does Continue do?**

Let's start with looking at this example containing a List.

```
shop_list = ["processor", "RAM", "SSD", "Power Supply", "Motherboard", "Keyboard", "Monitor"]

for an_item in shop_list:
    print("You have to buy {}".format(an_item))

print("*" * 100)
# What if I don't to buy Keyboard, how to exclude it

for an_item in shop_list:
    if an_item != "Keyboard":
        print("You have to buy {}".format(an_item))

print("*" * 100)
# We can also do this using 'continue'
# Basically it will skip where we encounter continue to next iteration
for an_item in shop_list:
    if an_item == "Keyboard":
        continue
    print("You have to buy {}".format(an_item))
```

**Not used very often, but can be useful.**

## Break

If you want to come out of for loop(or any other loop for that matter) completely, then use Break Statement.

Let's check out a couple of examples in the code:

```
# If I take the code that i ran for continue
# and replace continue with Break
# What will happen?

shop_list = ["processor", "RAM", "SSD", "Power Supply", "Motherboard", "Keyboard", "Monitor"]

for an_item in shop_list:
    if an_item == "Keyboard":
        break
    print("You have to buy {}".format(an_item))

# So it seems anything in the list after we break is skipped
# So, basically we come out of loop all together

```

Can be very Useful:

1. Say you are searching for something in a list containing 1000s of items.
```
# What we have to do is:
# 1. Search for the item mentioned in the list above.
# 2. If found print the index and come out of the loop
# 3. If not print -1

found_at = -1

for index in range(len(shop_list)):
    if shop_list[index] == item_to_search:
        found_at = index
        break
print("Item Found @ Position {}".format(found_at))
```

2. What if item isn't in the list
It will print -1 or None.. depending upon what ever the initial value of found_at was

**Use of Break in while loop**

Break is very common to see in While Loop.

Basically a condition is checked inside the while loop itself, and if condition is True we can do break to get out of the while loop.

Let's take Adventure Game as an example again, basically we are exiting through a direction... but we also want to exit in case we type 'quit'.

PFB the code:
```
available_exits = ["north", "east", "south", "west"]
chosen_exit = ""

while chosen_exit not in available_exits:
    print("You are still in the Maze!!! Muahahahahah Muahahahah")
    chosen_exit = input("Enter a direction : ")
    if chosen_exit == "quit":
        print("I quit!!")
        break
else:
    print("I am out!! I am out!! huff huff... or am I")
```
