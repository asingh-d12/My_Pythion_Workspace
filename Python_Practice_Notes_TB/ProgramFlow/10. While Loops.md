Apart from For Loops, we can also use While Loops.

While Loops are generally used in Use cases where we have to keep looping until some condition is false.

Basically we don't know how many times the loop will execute.

For ex:
```
while <a_condition>:
	<a block of code that will be executed while a_condition is true>
```

PFB an example code... this is identical to if we use for to iterate over a range

```
i = 0
while i < 10:
    print("i = {}".format(i))
    i += 1

```

**Remember, while is mostly used where we want to keep an execution going until a condition is met.**

PFB a very summarized example:
```
available_exits = ["north", "east", "south", "west"]
chosen_exit = ""

while chosen_exit not in available_exits:
    print("You are still in the Maze!!! Muahahahahah Muahahahah")
    chosen_exit = input("Enter a direction : ")

print("I am out!! I am out!! huff huff... or am I")

```

*Another great example is reading a file, we don't know how much data we have to read.*
