Loops are the 1 of the most important aspects of any machine and consequently programming.

Machines are better at this kind of job becuase they have much higher capability and many techniques to do something repeatedly(say million times) without any issue.

1 of the structure that can be used to do this kind of programmes is:

Loop - for loop, while loop in python

***

Let's understand For Loop:

A for loop in python works by iterating over some set of values.
>It binds to all the values 1 by 1.

>Then executes whatever is to be executed using this value before moving to next value.


A for loop iterates over an **iterable** object or a **Sequence Type**.

One of the Sequence Type we noticed earlier was **String**. We iterated over each character 1 by 1.

Anything that can be used with For Loop is an Iterable.

One of the Iterables that is not a Sequence Type is **range.**

PFB the code with simple for loop:
```
my_name = "Amritpal Singh Narula"

# we checked out in earlier to check basically a substring
# This is another use of 'in'

print("A simple For Loop")
for a_char in my_name:
    print(a_char)

print('*' * 100)

```
