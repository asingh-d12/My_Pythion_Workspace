Loops are the 1 of the most important aspects of any machine and consequently programming.

Machines are better at this kind of job becuase they have much higher capability and many techniques to do something repeatedly(say million times) without any issue.

1 of the structure that can be used to do this kind of programmes is:

Loop - for loop, while loop in python

***

Let's understand For Loop:

A for loop in python works by iterating over some set of values.
>It binds to all the values 1 by 1.

>Then executes whatever is to be executed using this value before moving to next value.


A for loop iterates over an **iterable** object or a **Sequence Type**.

One of the Sequence Type we noticed earlier was **String**. We iterated over each character 1 by 1.

Anything that can be used with For Loop is an Iterable.

One of the Iterables that is not a Sequence Type is **range.**

PFB the code with simple for loop:
```
my_name = "Amritpal Singh Narula"

# we checked out in earlier to check basically a substring
# This is another use of 'in'

print("A simple For Loop")
for a_char in my_name:
    print(a_char)

print('*' * 100)

```

## An example of an earlier code, now we are using FOR LOOP in it.

```
number = "9,223;372:036 854,775;807"
separators = ""

# Using For Loop to filter out and save the not numeric values
for a_char in number:
    # We can do something like this as well.
    # if not a_char.isnumeric():
    if a_char not in "1234567890":
        separators += a_char

print(separators)

final_op = ''.join([x if x not in separators else ' ' for x in number]).split()
print(final_op)
print([int(x) for x in final_op])

```

**Further making the above program more flexible by allowing user to enter the string number.**

```
# The main difference between this program and the above mentioned is that here we are going to as user to input number

number = input("Please enter a series of numbers with any separator you like : ")
separators = ""

for a_char in number:
    # We can do something like this as well.
    # if not a_char.isnumeric():
    if a_char not in "1234567890":
        separators += a_char

print(separators)

final_op = ''.join([x if x not in separators else ' ' for x in number]).split()
print(final_op)
print([int(x) for x in final_op])


```

The actual magic here is this part:
```
''.join([x if x not in separators else ' ' for x in number]).split()
```

What this line is actually doing is replacing any character that is present in separators with space

so

for ex: 1, 2; 3: 4 5:: 6, 7;47
After going through this line, 3 thigs are happening here
1. First, any and all separators are replaced by space first, and output we are geting is a list
>[1, , ,2, , ,3, , ,4, ,5, , , ,6, , ,7, ,47]

2. Next joining is happening with ''. so it becomes something like this
>"1  2  3  4 5   6  7 47"

3. Last, this is being split()... Now this is the wildcard here... 
	check this code for split() method out:
```
# Checking how simple split works
a_str = "a b c d"
print(a_str.split())

a_str = "a    \nb  c  d"
print(a_str.split())

a_str = "a b c \n\t   d"
print(a_str.split())

a_str = "a b   \t\nc d"
print(a_str.split())

a_str = "a    b c   d"
print(a_str.split())
	
```

So, basically no matter what is the "white space" character(\t, \n, ' ' etc are all white space characters).

split() method doesn't care how many white space characters are between 2 strings, and it splits them when used without any argument.

***

## Iterating over a range
Ranges are also iterable, though not sequence type.. we can still iterate over it.

Let's check this code out:
```
for i in range(1, 20):
    print(i)

```

Range also like slices doesn't include the last value... basically from start to end - 1
