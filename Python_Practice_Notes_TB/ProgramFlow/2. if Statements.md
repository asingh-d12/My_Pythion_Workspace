So, let's talk about conditions, take a look at this code:
```
name = input("What is your name? : ")
# Remember age is supposed to be int, so let's convert age to int using int() function
age = int(input("How old are you {}? : ".format(name)))
# Remember, that if you try to enter any value other than an int in age, when python tries to convert age to int, it will throw ValueError
print("{}, you are {} yrs old.".format(name, age))

# Now, we are going to check a condition using if statement
# Basically, we are going to check if the person is old enough to vote.
# This will be on basis of condition that will added on age
if age >= 18:
    print("{}, you are old enough to Vote.".format(name))

```

Here, we are asking name and age. Depending upon the age, we will print if person is old enough to vote or not.

Let's check out couple of inputs:
Age entered = 30
![[Pasted image 29.png]]

Age entered = 17
![[Pasted image 30.png]]
See here nothing is printed, and that is correct because the if condition is false

Age entered = 18
![[Pasted image 31.png]]

Last,
Age entered = eighteen
![[Pasted image 32.png]]

We get error here, which is expected because of the fact that int function can only convert int strings to int values.

**"if age >= 18"** -> This is the line where the condition is checked, and depending on age the if block is executed

*What if age is not >=18, then what... 'cause right now nothin's happenin'*

***

**if-else**

Let's take the same code we created above, but add else as well.

```
name = input("What is your name? : ")
# Remember age is supposed to be int, so let's convert age to int using int() function
age = int(input("How old are you {}? : ".format(name)))
# Remember, that if you try to enter any value other than an int in age, when python tries to convert age to int, it will throw ValueError
print("{}, you are {} yrs old.".format(name, age))

# Now, we are going to check a condition using if statement
# Basically, we are going to check if the person is old enough to vote.
# This will be on basis of condition that will added on age
if age >= 18:
    print("{}, you are old enough to Vote.".format(name))
else:
    # So, basically this is else block, kind of catch all in case no condition passes this block is executed
    print("{}, please come back in {} years.".format(name, (18-age)))

```

Let's check out a couple of outputs:
Age = 30
![[Pasted image 33.png]]

This is as expected

next, Age = 13
![[Pasted image 34.png]]

So, if you see the screenshot above, the else block is executed.

***

**Let's talk about if-elif-else**
So, we studied about if-else above, now let's talk about elif

***elif*** is used in case where we want to check more than one coditions but not at the same time.

Let's take the code above:
There is 1 more condition i want to add

say if person's age > 65, polling will done in a special Older Citizen Booth and at some defined date and time... how to add this

Let's check this code out:

```
name = input("What is your name? : ")
# Remember age is supposed to be int, so let's convert age to int using int() function
age = int(input("How old are you {}? : ".format(name)))
# Remember, that if you try to enter any value other than an int in age, when python tries to convert age to int, it will throw ValueError
print("{}, you are {} yrs old.".format(name, age))

# Now, we are going to check a condition using if statement
# Basically, we are going to check if the person is old enough to vote.
# This will be on basis of condition that will added on age
if age >= 65:
    print("{}, You are eligible for Older Citizen Voting Facility.".format(name))
    print("Your date time slot is as follows:2020-06-29 12:12:45 PM.")
elif age >= 18:
    print("{}. you are eligible to vote.".format(name))
else:
    # So, basically this is else block, kind of catch all in case no condition passes this block is executed
    print("{}, please come back in {} years.".format(name, (18-age)))

# Now if you note above if-elif-else, you can see that the condition if person is > 65 is checked first
# Then it is checked if person is aged > 18
# last is else
# Why can't we check first for >18.... It's obvious...
# Basically 65 is also > 18, so if a person age >= 65, for him/her as well the >18 code block will execute
# and in if-elif-else, once 1 code block executes control goes back to outside
# So, keep in mind to always check narrower condition first before more broader one

```

Please go through the comments in the code above.

Now let's check the outputs.

Age = 65
![[Pasted image 35.png]]

Age = 80
![[Pasted image 36.png]]

Age = 18
![[Pasted image 37.png]]

Age = 64
![[Pasted image 38.png]]

Age = 17
![[Pasted image 39.png]]
