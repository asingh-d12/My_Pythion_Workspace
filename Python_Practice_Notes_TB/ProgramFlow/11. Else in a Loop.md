Else not only can be used in if-else

but also in loops

though there is 1 reason why using else in loops are avoided... basically using else in loops means completely different thing than what it means in if-else.


**so.. what does it mean to use else in the loop**

It basically means that your loop is executed and completed properly without any issue, and so else has to be executed.

If loop does not complete, mainly the reason being break.. else block is not executed.

PFB an example(GO through comments in the code):
```
# So this is one of the examples I used else in loop
# Though Avoid it
# So, what's happening

# We have a list, which is checked for available exits
available_exits = ["north", "east", "south", "west"]
chosen_exit = ""

# This is loop where a user is asked for a direction to exit,
# This direction is then checked against available_exits list,
# If direction is present, then cool.. you are out of loop
# If not, then rinse and repeat...
# But there is 1 more twist
# If user enters "quit" instead of a direction
while chosen_exit not in available_exits:
    print("You are still in the Maze!!! Muahahahahah Muahahahah")
    chosen_exit = input("Enter a direction : ").lower()
    # If user enters "quit" then,
    # User goes out of loop with a break statement
    if chosen_exit == "quit":
        print("I quit!!")
        break
else:
    # So, why use else here and when does it execute
    # Basically, we do not want a user who "quits" the game to see this
    # This message is only for users who played this game completely
    # So, this is in else block
    # When the game is "quitted", break is encountered,
    # due to the break statement, this else block is not executed
    print("I am out!! I am out!! huff huff... or am I")

```
