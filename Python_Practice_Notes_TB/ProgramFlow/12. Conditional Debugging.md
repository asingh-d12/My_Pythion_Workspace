Basically, we are trying to debug the Hi Lo Game, but the issue is it required input('h' or 'l') and  what if there were more than 10 guesses(or more than 1000 numbers).

**Here comes conditional Debugging**

How it can help, basically by making sure that debugging starts only if we have reached a certain number.

Basically right click on breakpoint, and add your condition there:

I choose number 837 -- didn't work in this case
will work only for even number guesses - mainly the condition start == end
No, not for Even.. what about 250 ... hmmm
So, for what type of numbers does this condition comes true... what is the common factor?



let's take 838
PFB the code:
```
max_val = 1000
print("Please think of a number 1 - 1000, and I will try to guess in 10 tries...")
input("Press Enter to Start!!")

# user_input = int(input("Please guess a number between 1 and {} : ".format(max_val)))

# So, here we are using Binary Search, so instead of taking input from user, let's take how this works
start = 1
end = 1000

mid_pt_guess = (start + end) // 2

attempt_num = 1

# Let's transform this code so that we can run this with while loop
while start != end:
    print("My guess is {}. Is this your number??".format(mid_pt_guess))
    h_or_l = input("Please enter h/high/higher if your number is higher than my guess.\n"
                   "Please enter l/low/lower if your number is lower than my guess.\n"
                   "Just Press Enter if this is your number.\nPlease Enter : ")
    if 'l' in h_or_l.casefold():
        end = mid_pt_guess - 1
    elif 'h' in h_or_l.casefold():
        start = mid_pt_guess + 1
    else:
        print("*" * 100)
        print("Awesome, your number is {}, and it took me {} attempts to guess it.".format(mid_pt_guess, attempt_num))
        break
    mid_pt_guess = (start + end) // 2
    attempt_num += 1
else:
    print("Awesome your number is {}".format((start + end)//2))
    print("It took me {} attempts to guess it.".format(attempt_num))

```

Here 837 is chosen because of 
start = 836
end = 838
mid = (836 + 838) / 2

now 838 > 837, which i will enter
so start = mid + 1

so start = 838
and start == end

so, we should see debug start next i press h
