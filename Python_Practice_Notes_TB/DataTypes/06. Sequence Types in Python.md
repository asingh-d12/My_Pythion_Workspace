So, Python has couple of sequence types

String being one of the most important one of them.
>1. String
>2. Tuple
>3. List
>4. Range
>5. Bytes and Bytesarray - not sure about this one *yet*

**What is a sequence?**
Basically an *Ordered set of items.*
The recent Sequence Type we went through was String.
ex. "Hello World" consists of 11 characters in sequence

**List** is also a sequence type, for ex. a shopping list
["Soap", "Bread", "Jam", "Basket"]
The list above contains 4 items or 4 sequence of items.

**Because Sequence is *ordered*, we have the capability of using index on these sequences.**  Also, called subscriptable.

so, for ex:
a_list = ["a", "amrit", "b", "banana"]
a_list[1] = "amrit"

and we can even go further deeper down to access sequence in the sequence
a_list[1][1] = "m"

**Range is the sequece that can not be concatenated or multiplied.**

***
**Here are a couple of operations with sequence types**

1. String

```
str1 = 'Python'
str2 = 'is'
str3 = 'an'
str4 = 'awesome'
str5 = 'programming'
str6 = 'language'

# Concatenation can be done in 2 ways
print(str1+str2+str3+str4+str5+str6)

# or we can do this
print(str1, str2, str3, str4, str5, str6)

# Multiplication is also possible with String, though it is more like concatenation that actual multiplication
a_str = "Hello World"
print('Original String = {}'.format(a_str))
print('Original String * 2= {}'.format(a_str * 2))
print('Original String * 4= {}'.format(a_str * 4))
print('Original String * 10= {}'.format(a_str * 10))

# So, as it can be seen from the output, the string is concatenated as many times as the multiple is mentioned

```

**Remember when doing operations like "\*" or "+" with String, remember operator precedence still applies, and can cause issues**
PFB an example:
```
a_str = "Hello "
print("Original String = {}".format(a_str))
print("Original String * 4 = {}".format(a_str * 4))
print("Original String *4 + 8 = {}".format(a_str * 4 + 8))

```

**Though these are pretty fine**
```
a_str = "Hello "
print("Original String = {}".format(a_str))
print("Original String * 5 = {}".format(a_str * 5))
print("Original String * (5 + 4) = {}".format(a_str * (5 + 4)))
# Or even this is fine
print("Original String * 5 + \"4\" = {}".format(a_str * 5 + "4"))

```
