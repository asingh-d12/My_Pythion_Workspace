**So there are a couple of ways in which a String can be concatenated, and *is very useful, specifically when printing*.**

Let's take a look at this example:
```
name = "Amrit"
age = 30
hobby = "fanfic reading"
# No Printing the above variables using String formatting
print("My name is {}, I am {} years old. I have an odd hobby of {}. Now, can you please introduce yourself?".format(name, age, hobby))

```
