**So there are a couple of ways in which a String can be concatenated, and *is very useful, specifically when printing*.**

Let's take a look at this example:
```
name = "Amrit"
age = 30
hobby = "fanfic reading"
# No Printing the above variables using String formatting
print("My name is {}, I am {} years old. I have an odd hobby of {}. Now, can you please introduce yourself?".format(name, age, hobby))

```

**Let's talk about some more of String Formatting today**

So, let's start with a simple example.
```
for i in range(1,  13):
    print("Number = {}, Squared = {}, Cubed = {}".format(i, i**2, i**3))
    
```

What this is going to do is, going to print a number i, the i^2 and then i^3.

Let's see the output:

*The output is good, but alignment is not very good.*

Coming to the point, we can also use String Formatting to Format the Strings that are printed in the output.

1. int formatting - with space: What we are about to do is how int values are formatted
```
for i in range(1,  13):
    # :2, :3 and :4 refers to the number of spaces the output will take
    # This is mainly in case of string formatting integer values
    print("Number = {:2}, Squared = {:3}, Cubed = {:4}".format(i, i**2, i**3))

```

Now after adding :2, :3 and :4, what is the output?

2. int formatting - with 0s : we can do same int formatting with 0s
```
for i in range(1,  13):
    # :2, :3 and :4 refers to the number of spaces the output will take
    # We can simply add 0 infront of number of spaces for 0 formatting
    # :02, :03 and :04
    # This is mainly in case of string formatting integer values
    print("Number = {:02}, Squared = {:03}, Cubed = {:04}".format(i, i**2, i**3))

```

3. int Formatting - left aligned: ok, so we can do this as well, by default any formatting is done right aligned(i.e. any spaces or 0s are in the left)... we can change that so formatting is done left aligned using '<' symbol... check this out
```
for i in range(1,  13):
    # :2, :3 and :4 refers to the number of spaces the output will take
    # We can simply add 0 infront of number of spaces for 0 formatting
    # :02, :03 and :04
    # We can also use symbol '<' to do left alignment, instead of default right alignment
    # This is mainly in case of string formatting integer values
    print("Number = {:<2}, Squared = {:<3}, Cubed = {:<4}".format(i, i**2, i**3))

```

4. int formatting - center aligned : So, we can do center aligned as well, by using '^' symbol... so check this code out, that has all three - left aligned, right aligned(default or use '>') and center aligned
```
for i in range(1,  13):
    # :2, :3 and :4 refers to the number of spaces the output will take
    # We can simply add 0 infront of number of spaces for 0 formatting
    # :02, :03 and :04
    # We can also use symbol '<' to do left alignment, instead of default right alignment
    # lastly, we can use symbol '^' for center alignment as well
    # This is mainly in case of string formatting integer values
    print("Number = {:2}, Squared = {:<3}, Cubed = {:^4}".format(i, i**2, i**3))
```

What about String Formatting for Float values, let's check it out...

5. Float Formatting : for floating point number we can provide width and precision when doing String Formatting... check this out...

Check out all these examples, as these are combination of examples accumulated from above mentioned int formatting along with some additional precision based formatting for float.
```
pi = 22/7
print("Value of pi without formatting = {}".format(pi))
print("Value of pi adding width of 50 = {:50}".format(pi))
print("Value of pi adding width of 50 with 0 = {:050}".format(pi))
print("Value of pi adding width of 50 left aligned = {:<50}".format(pi))
# So adding .<num>f after the width will provide us with the precision
# 50.3f means width of 50 with 3 precision
# remember if precision is higher than width, precision always trumps width, example being :12.50f
# Also, as can be seen the in the example :55.54f, the precision is 54 but pi has precision of 51 only and so it adds 0 instead of space for remaining precision values
print("Value of pi adding width of 55 and precision of 54 = {:55.54f}".format(pi))
print("Value of pi adding width of 52 and precision of 50 = {:52.50f}".format(pi))
print("Value of pi adding width of 12 and precision of 50 = {:12.50f}".format(pi))
print("Value of pi adding width of 70 and precision of 50 = {:72.50f}".format(pi))

# To Conclude:
# If the width provided is more than what the actual printed variable can use, it prints ' ' by default.
# If the precision provided is more than what the actual printed variable can use, it prints '0' by default.
```
