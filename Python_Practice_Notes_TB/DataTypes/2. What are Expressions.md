Anything that has a value or is getting evaluated through some operations.

for ex:
all of these have ranges
x = 1 
y = 45
z = x + 45
print(a + v + 4 + b)
range() is also an expression as it evaluates to something

Anything that evaluates to something are expression.

Expressions are only on the right of the assignment/binding.. never the left

so 
x = 1, 2, 3, 4

1, 2, 3, 4 is an expression
x is not
