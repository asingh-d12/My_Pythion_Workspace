**Let's start with Numeric Data Type**

Python3 has 3 numeric data type:
1. int
2. float
3. complex - Not going to study

*Trivia - In Python2, there is long as well, since int in Python2 can't support very large values*

**int**
Whole Numbers
No decimal or fraction

**float**
Fractional
With Decimal

Computations with int are distinctly faster than float.

Python3 int has no maximum size.

Python Float has 52 level in precision.

Let's try some code with ints and floats:
