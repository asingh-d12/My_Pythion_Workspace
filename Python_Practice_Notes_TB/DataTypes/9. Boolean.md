A boolean value is a value that can either be True or False.

There are only 2 values for type Boolean true and false, and in python they are represneted as follows:
1. True
2. False

All conditional expressions are reduced to a boolean value in the end. PFB an example:

```
if name == "Amrit" and age > 18 and (hobby in ['basketball', 'baseball']):
	print("Hello")
```

So this expression containing several conditions will reduce to boolean in the end.
