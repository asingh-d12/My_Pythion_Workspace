What is PEP

PEP is Python Enhancement Proposal

Basically any change to be done in python starts with a PEP, and then go through several stages and then either approved or rejected.

PEP-8 is the style guide of Python, first written in 2001.

It contains several facts like how to write code, how to name variables, how to add syntax etc.
