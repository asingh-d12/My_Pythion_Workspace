Whenver we run some code, everything is stored in Physical Memory.
Program is stored in one area in the memory, and the data it works upon is stored somewhere in memory as well.

A variable basically stores the location of memory where the data is stored, so when we create some variable.

say
```
x = 10
y = 25.54
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
it is not the actual data that is store in the variables x, y and a_list... but they store what is the address of the data.

so a_list stores the memory address of the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

***
**Rules of variable names**
1. can only start from uppercase or lowercase letters, or from _(underscore).
2. they can only contain letters, numbers or underscore(but can not start with a number).
3. python variables are case sensitive, so greeting and Greeting are 2 different variables.
4. Variables are created when they are first attached to value using '='.
