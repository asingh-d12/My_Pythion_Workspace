## What to we mean by - Explore Print Function
print function is a simple thing right...
```
name = "Amrit"
age = 30
print(name, age, "hello", "2020")
```

See, out put as expected.... or is it...

1. Do we know why we are seeing ' ' between several items we are printing
2. or why there is a new line after what ever is printed
3. or how even can it print n number of items - this we won't be discussing here.... to add link later(remember *args)

So, here we are gonna think about 1 and 2 points.

Check out this syntax of our print function.
**print(\*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)**

What does this actually mean...
what is sep? why is it ' '?
what is end? why is it '\n'?
Let's leave other things for now...

i hope the things are getting clearer...

yes..

**sep is separator between the items printed in a single print statement, and by default it is ' '... sep=' ' is a keyword argument with defaault value of ' '**
**end is what comes after the print function ends... by defaault it is '\n'**

So, if we don't provide these keyword arguments in print function, it simply takes the default values.

Check out this code:
```
name = "Amrit"
age = 30
print(name, age, "hello", "2020")

print('*' * 50)
# what is sep in print function?
# A: It is a keyword argument that tells what 'sep'arator to use
# between various items printed in a single print statement.
# By default it is ' '
# Check this out
print(name, age, "hello", "2020", sep='; ')
# What will happen? this should print with "; " as a separator
# 1 more example
print(name, age, "hello", "2020", sep=':')

print("*" * 50)

# Next, what is end?
# Also another keyword argument with default value of '\n'
# Check out this code...
# with default value
print(name, age, "hello", "2020")
print(name, age, "hello", "2020")
# Changing end='; '
print(name, age, "hello", "2020", end='; ')
print(name, age, "hello", "2020")

```
