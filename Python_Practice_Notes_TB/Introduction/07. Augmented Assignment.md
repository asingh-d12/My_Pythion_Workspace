Basically say we are doing something like this

x = 1
x = x + 1

This is something that can be done is a better way, which is called augmented assignment.

PFB more details and code:
```
# So whatis Augmented Assignment
# So i have this

x = 20
x = x + 1
# This can be done in a better way... how?
# Augmented assignment
x += 1

# What's the difference
# There are few extra step in x = x + 1
# 1. look up guess
# 2. Add 1 to guesses
# 3. Put it in a memory location
# 4. bind it to variable x

# With Augmented Assignment
# 1. Simply add 1 to x

# We can also do this
x = 20
print(x)
x -= 4
print(x)
x /= 12
print(x)
x //= 2
print(x)
x %= 12
print(x)
x *= 56
print(x)
x **= 2
print(x)

# They can be performed on String as well
x_string = "My name is"
print(x_string)
x_string += " Amrit"
print(x_string)

# or we can do this as well
x_string *= 5
print(x_string)

```
