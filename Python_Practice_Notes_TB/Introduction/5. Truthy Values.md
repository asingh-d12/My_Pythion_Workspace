## What is Truthy Values.

Basically values that are simply evaluated implicitly or explicitly to True.

Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.

By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a __bool__() method that returns False or a __len__() method that returns zero, when called with the object. 

All of these are falsy values
> constants defined to be false: None and False.

> zero of any numeric type: 0, 0.0, 0j, Decimal(0), Fraction(0, 1)

> empty sequences and collections: '', (), [], {}, set(), range(0)

```
print("Let's check out some of the values that are treated as false")

print(bool(0))
print(bool(''))
print(bool(' '))
print(bool(None))

print("PFB 1 of the use")
your_name = input("Please enter your name : ")
if your_name:
    print("Your Name = {}".format(your_name))
else:
    print("Please find your Birth Certificate.")
```
