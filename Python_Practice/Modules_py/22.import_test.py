# Here I am going to try importing 1 of the previous py code I created
import tkinter_challenge_to_import

# Now i am adding a simple print statement
print("Hello!!")

# What will happen when I run this file?
# So, what is happening is
# 1. the calculator that we created in tkinter_challenge_to_import is opening automatically.. even if we don't
# want it to open
# 2. Then once we close the calculator, print statement is executed

# Why is this?
# because the code in the imported file is actually running all the code outside or that is global
