1. Dealer deals 1 card to each player and then to himself
2. Each player but not the dealer then gets the second card
3. The player then decides whether to stick with the cards they have or hit(i.e. to get another card)
4. Player can hit as many times as he wants, but as soon as there total goes over 21 they are bust, and Game Over for the player
5. The cards that player hold  when they finish is called there hand
6. Once all the players are stuck or bust, then dealer gets then second card and then dealer then decide whether to stick or hit
7. If dealer goes over 21, then dealer is bust and all the players that stick wins
8. There is another constraint - The dealer can not stick on less than 17
9. So, in our version of this game we will have this - dealer must stick they have 17 or more
10. Once dealer is finished, the players that have total more than dealer wins and the ones with less total looses.
11. If dealer and player have same score, then they effectively draw.

To keep it simple, we are going to play with single player

Cards - 52
1 - 10
Jack, King and Queen - each value of 10
4 Suites - Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds and spades

1 Final complication:
Ace can have value of 1 as well as 11 and depending upon total player can decide what number player will take
